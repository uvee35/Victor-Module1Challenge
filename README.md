# Accessible Web Design for Marketing Agency

## Project Overview

In this project, I refactored an existing website for a marketing agency to enhance web accessibility. The focus was to ensure the site adheres to accessibility standards, optimizing it for search engines and making it usable for people with disabilities.

### Key Features

- Semantic HTML elements for better structure and readability.
- Logical HTML structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Accessible `alt` attributes for all image and icon elements.
- Sequential heading attributes for a coherent flow.
- Descriptive title elements for better SEO and usability.

## Development Approach

### Semantic HTML

I reviewed the existing HTML structure and replaced divs and other non-semantic elements with semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc., to improve the document structure and context.

### Accessible Images

All images and icons were provided with descriptive `alt` attributes to ensure they are accessible to screen readers, thereby enhancing the site's usability for visually impaired users.

### Sequential Headings and Descriptive Titles

Ensured headings are used in a sequential manner (h1 followed by h2, etc.) and are descriptive of the content they represent. Titles are concise and reflective of the page content, aiding in SEO and user navigation.

### Refactoring CSS

Refactored the CSS to improve efficiency and organization:

- Consolidated selectors and properties.
- Organized CSS to follow the semantic HTML structure.
- Included comments for clarity.
